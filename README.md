# Container Library C++ 

Welcome to the Container Library C++ repository! This repository contains a comprehensive and efficient set of container classes implemented in C++ that you can readily use in your projects. It covers a variety of data structures, from simple to more advanced ones, offering an easy-to-use and flexible solution for all your container needs.

## Containers Included
The following container classes are implemented in this library:

* **Stack**: A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that supports standard stack operations such as push, pop, and peek.
* **Queue**: A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure that supports standard queue operations such as enqueue, dequeue, and front.
* **Priority Queue**: A specialized queue that maintains its elements in a sorted order based on priority, allowing for efficient access to the highest-priority element.
* **Single Linked List**: A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the list.
* **Doubly Linked List**: A linear data structure similar to a single linked list, but with each node containing pointers to both the next and the previous nodes.
## Getting Started
To get started with the Container Library C++, simply clone this repository and include the relevant header files in your project.

```git
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ContainerLibraryCPP.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, include the desired container header file(s) in your C++ source code:

```cpp
#include "stack.h"
#include "single_link_list.h"
#include "doubly_linked_list.h"
#include "queue.h"
#include "priority_queue.h"

```
## :book: Documentation
Each container class comes with comprehensive documentation, including instructions on how to use the class and details about its methods, properties, and complexity. You can find this documentation in the header files associated with each container.

## :wrench: Contributing
**We welcome contributions to the Container Library C++ repository. If you have a suggestion for a new container or an improvement to an existing one, please open an issue or submit a pull request.**
